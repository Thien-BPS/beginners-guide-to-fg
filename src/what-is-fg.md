# What is Fictional Googology?

**Fictional Googology** is the study of large, _fictional_ numbers. It isn't meant as an actual rigorous field of study ([although there are people who treat it like so](./rigors/README.md)).

**Absolute Infinity** (denoted as Ω or ת) here is an entry that is bigger than any finite or transfinite conceivable quantity. Every property of Absolute Infinity is also held by some smaller object, which fulfills the [reflection principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_principle).

> But doesn't that mean all Fictional Googology entries falls under Absolute Infinity?

Yes, Fictional Googology may seem contradictory at first, because any property of any number in fictional googology should be held by Absolute Infinity. However, this is called **Fictional** Googology for a reason because it isn't real, and either are any of the numbers. Fictional Googology should be treated more like an artform then an actual field of study.

We'll cover some of the important concepts later such as:

- Classifications
- Notations
- Breakings
- Cycles (and its variants)
- Scales

...and so on and so forth. But first, we must understand the community's history to provide context for why things are done the way they are.
