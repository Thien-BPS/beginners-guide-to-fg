# Sequences
**Sequences** are a concept created by SuperWindows78, which involves a cycling of a set of symbols or words that are used. These are similar to [loops](./loops.md) but rather then repeating previous numbers, it repeats your own set of symbols.

Like loops, each repeat makes the entry more powerful and increments the repeat counter.

These aren't often used within the community anymore, most sequences are from early-FG (???? [3] / LOE days), and we don't know why.
