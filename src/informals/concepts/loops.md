# Loops
**Loops** are a type of segment in an FG video where you repeat the previous entries that came before. Each repeat increments the loop counter and makes the current repeat more powerful then the previous.

Loops can be used as a recap section in long videos, but typically serves as a break from the normal entries segment before the next entries segment.
