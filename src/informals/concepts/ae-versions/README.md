# Absolutely Everything Versions
An **Absolutely Everything Version**  (aka. AEs or A.E. versions) is a segment of a Fictional Googology video that applies many layers of audiovisual effects in order to give a sense of chaos and disorder.

> [!CAUTION]
> A.E. versions are **designed by nature to be flashy and loud**, which **will** cause problems for several groups of people, particularly anyone who is photosensitive.	 Be careful when creating or watching these kinds of segments.

There are many kinds of AEs, which are:
