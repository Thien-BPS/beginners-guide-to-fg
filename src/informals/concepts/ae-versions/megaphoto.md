# Megaphoto Segments
**Megaphoto Segments** are usually found after the [layers](./layers.md) section in an A.E. segment and as the name suggests, uses the effects of the Megaphoto video editor in order to create unique looking visuals.

Unlike other A.E. segments, **Megaphoto Segments** have very different visuals because of the completely different effects provided by the video editor. As such, you may see more shapes-looking visuals rather then rainbow or glitchy style visuals.

> [!NOTE]
> Megaphoto is **only** available on iOS and Android devices. There is **no** support for desktop environments, so it would not be possible to create this kind of segment if you do not have a mobile device.
