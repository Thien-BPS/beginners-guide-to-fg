# Layers
**Layers** are a kind of A.E. aspect that involves duplicating the video and splitting it into different spots and arranging them in a way to display a pattern.

> [!NOTE]
> These should not be confused with [Video Layers](./video-layers.md), which has a similar name but is a different concept.

This is one of the most commonly seen aspects about an A.E. version within the wider community, mainly used in order for people to show off their layers skills. There are some videos that has A.E. versions but doesn't have layers but those are quite rare nowadays.

Between the concept of layers, there's two kinds:
- **Effect-based Layers:** Extremely rarely used, these layers apply visual effects on top of the existing pattern that the exports are already arranged in. Seen within NO!'s Numbers 0 to ??? [???] series.
- **Pattern-based Layers:** The most common of the two, these layers apply some of the most intricate patterns in order to give a visual appeal to the viewer. Also used to show off people's skills.
