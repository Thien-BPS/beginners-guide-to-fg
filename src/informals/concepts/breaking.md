# Breaking
**Breaking** is the act of exhausting a concept by continually counting higher and higher levels of the concept until you reach its limit.

There are several things you can break, such as classifications, cycles, hierarchies, and even things that wouldn't make sense like the act of breaking itself. Typically, after breaking the concept, a new higher form of the concept is used in order to continue use the idea.

There are many kinds of "breaking" values and levels. The pseudo-field of study for this is called Breakology, where you try to find how far you can exhaust something.

## Entirallisms
**Entirallism Levels** is a small part of Breakology where some values require special conditions to count under such value.

Some of the values within this area are:
- **Prebroken:** When a value is broken before it was reached. Can be applied to all other levels.
- **Visual:** A value must be visibly seen to count under this.
- **Actual:** Based on technicality, it has to count.
- **Literal:** Values must be realistically possible within RL to count.
- **Proper:** Must be logically sound in order to count.
- **Strict:** There cannot be any other conditions for it to count.
- **Empiricals:** It must count under what the author thinks it is.
