# Classifications
A **classification** is a set of numbers grouped by how they are related to each other. However, this isn't always the case depending on which FG videos you watch.

There are many kinds of classifications, some of them can be found in the [Additional FG Expansion Charts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o48spBes-bJzfCb12mUf_ID1Sar4N3Uk2Q5kC3aOBKU/edit?gid=2009808058#gid=2009808058). Here, we'll give a brief list of classifications from NO!'s ???? [x] and Daniel Dixon's Numbers 0 to LOE series.

- Hierarchies (classifications of classifications)

You may notice a few patterns. First of all, the way you continue off classifications is by using a word that is applied on top of the classification (Super OLs, Mega OLs, etc.). Typically, these are SI unit words. This pattern of words is called "Breakology", because this is how you "break" or exhaust a classification.

Second, lower classifications can be applied on top of higher ones (eg. Ordinal~Finitial Stage or Ordinal~Classes). This method of stacking classifications on itself is how to get to the next classification's level.
