# Before Cyclings
Before there was things such as Cycles and A.E. versions, we had simple numbers. Perhaps childish, and immature, but still some of the first entries within the community. Entries like **Absolutely True End**, or more ridiculously, **Too Much Massive Finity** (which by the way is a jumpscare).

Some of the earliest numbers were based around simple notations. Some were more complex, being full-span equations, but the early history started with just, simple functions. Things like the [X notation](./c2/notations/x-notation.md) for example.

Let's explore some of them shall we?
