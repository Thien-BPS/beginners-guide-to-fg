# What is this branch?

**Informal Fictional Googology** (aka. Informal FG) is a sub-space of the wider Fictional Googology community that primarily resides on YouTube.

Like the name suggests, it is a more informal version of Fictional Googology, being meant and treated more like an artform then a real field of study. It also mostly doesn't have definitions or well-defined intrinsics, although there is an attempt of formalizing and standardizing many concepts being done by [the BBN Foundation](../bbn-foundation.md).
